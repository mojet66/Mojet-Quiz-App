# MOJET QUIZ APP

## Project Description 

Mojet Quiz App is a responsive web application that allows users to take quizzes across different categories and difficulty levels. Users can select the number of questions, answer them in real time, view detailed results, and track their quiz history.

The application focuses on clean UI design, efficient state management, and persistent data storage so quiz history remains available even after refreshing the page.

## Tech Stack Used

- Tailwind CSS

- Vite

- Open Trivia API (for quiz data)

- LocalStorage (for persistence)

## Limitations/Known Issues

- No user authentication system.

- No backend database integration.

- The app depends on external API availability.

- No timer feature implemented yet.

## What i Learned
Building Mojet Quiz App helped me strengthen both frontend architecture and state management skills. Key takeaways include:

- How to structure a multi-page React application cleanly.

- Managing global state effectively using Zustand.

- Persisting application state to localStorage.

- Designing responsive layouts using Tailwind CSS breakpoints.

- Creating reusable UI components.

- Handling asynchronous API data and error states.

- Structuring a project for scalability and maintainability.

This project also improved my understanding of user experience flow, especially around quiz progression, result calculation, and historical tracking.
